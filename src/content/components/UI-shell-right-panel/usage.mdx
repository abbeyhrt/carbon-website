tabs: ['Code', 'Usage', 'Style']

## General guidance

The UI shell is made up of three components: The [primary header](/components/UI-shell-header/usage), the left panel, and the [right panel](/components/UI-shell-right-panel/usage). All three can be used independently, but the components were designed to work together.

| Shell UI component      |   |
|-------------|---|
| Header      | The highest level of navigation. The header can be used on its own for simple products or be used to trigger the left and right panels.|
| Left panel  | An optional panel that is used for a product's local navigation.|
| Right panel | An optional panel that can show additional actions or content associated with an icon in the header.|

## Anatomy

Header panels are vertical panels that are anchored in the header and invoked by controls on the right side of the header. Header panels have a consistent width, span the full height of the viewport, and are flush to the right edge of the viewport. Only one header panel can be open at a time. Header panels are always treated as floating panels.

Use a header panel when additional content or actions associated with a header icon needs to be shown upon click. Profile and notifications panels are good examples of this element in action. More details about panel types and behaviors can be found under the Layout section.
