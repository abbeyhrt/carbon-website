## General guidance

The UI shell is made up of three components: The [primary header](/components/UI-shell-header/usage), the left panel, and the [right panel](/components/UI-shell-right-panel/usage). All three can be used independently, but the components were designed to work together.

| Shell UI component      |   |
|-------------|---|
| Header      | The highest level of navigation. The header can be used on its own for simple products or be used to trigger the left and right panels.|
| Left panel  | An optional panel that is used for a product's local navigation.|
| Right panel | An optional panel that can show additional actions or content associated with an icon in the header.|

## Anatomy

The right panel is a vertical panel that is anchored to the header and invoked by icons on the right side of the header. Right panels have a consistent width, span the full height of the viewport, and are flush to the right edge of the viewport. Only one right panel can be open at a time. Right panels are always treated as floating panels.

 The right panel is used as a header panel and the app switcher.

### Header panel

Use a header panel when additional content or actions associated with a header icon needs to be shown upon click. Profile and notifications panels are good examples of this element in action.

### App switcher

The far right header icon is reserved for the app switcher icon. The app switcher icon and the app switcher panel should only be used together.
